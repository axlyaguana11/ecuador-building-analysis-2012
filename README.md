The purpose of this project is to understand construction through data in 2012. This industry 
plays a key role in [Ecuadorian economy](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econom%C3%ADa_de_Ecuador), and that's why
an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is necessary in order to identyfy patterns.

The process I followed is extracting data, understanding and cleaning, descriptive statistics and make conclusions.

The analysis is divided into univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, I use visual (data visualization) 
and numerical (tables) resources. 

Pandas is the library I used for data analysis. On the other hand, for data visualization I used Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Data 

Data was extracted from: http://catalogo.datosabiertos.gob.ec/dataset/esta

This data is public and anyone can use it. INEC is the organization that collected the data.

Data is about construction permits in 2012. Thus, some of the buildings may have not been carried out.

## How to read this repository

* The folder *data* contains the raw data by INEC `bdd-edificaciones-2012.csv` and the cleanded data `df_cleaned.csv`.

* The file `data_cleaning.ipynb` is where I cleaned the data, keeping relevant data only.

* The file `analysis.ipynb` is where I performed the EDA. Here you can find the introduction, the analysis and conclusions 
and recommendations.
